Agendrix dotfiles
===

Mostly a set of zsh & git configuration files, running on OS X.

A lot of the stuff here is based on Ryan Bates, Thoughtbot and Holman dotfiles, thanks guys!

## Installation

Run the following commands in your terminal. It will prompt you before it does anything destructive. Check out the [Rakefile](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles/blob/custom-bash-zsh/Rakefile) to see exactly what it does.

```
git clone https://github.com/agendrix/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake install
```

After installing, open a new terminal window to see the effects.

Feel free to customize the .zshrc file to match your preference.

## Using your own config along

These dotfiles require this file:

```
~/.zshrc.local
```

Here you can add your own mapping without risking to lose them when updating the repo :)

## Uninstall

To remove the dotfiles configurations, run the following commands. Be certain to double check the contents of the files before removing so you don't lose custom settings.

```
unlink ~/.bin
unlink ~/.gitignore
unlink ~/.gemrc
unlink ~/.irbrc
rm ~/.zshrc
rm ~/.gitconfig
rm -rf ~/.dotfiles
rm -rf ~/.oh-my-zsh
chsh -s /bin/bash # change back to Bash if you want
```

Then open a new terminal window to see the effects.
